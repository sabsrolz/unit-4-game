# unit-4-game

Description of the game:

Welcome to the crystal game. A score goal will be randomly generated at the beginning of each round. When you click on each of the four crystals, a number of points will also be randomly generated for each crystal. The purpose of the game is to attain the goal score, by adding up the individual points of each crystal every time they are clicked. The player wins when they match the current score to the goal. However, the player loses when the current score is higher than the goal. Press the reset button every time a round ends. Good luck!

Instructions:

1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
2. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
4. Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
5. When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
6. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
7. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
8. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
9. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
10. The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

Technology used:

In this assignment, I created another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.
